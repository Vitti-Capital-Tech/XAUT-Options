-- Run this whole file in the Supabase SQL Editor after 0059.
--
-- Stale quotes. On 02 Sep at 08:53:24 the engine opened three pairs and then
-- closed the entire call side within eighteen seconds:
--
--   08:53:24  sold C-4320 @ 8.00, C-4330 @ 5.50, C-4340 @ 3.60  (+ the puts)
--   08:53:30  ATM reached — shifted C-4320 further out
--   08:53:36  ATM reached — closed C-4330 in full
--   08:53:42  ATM reached — closed C-4340 in full
--   08:53:48  sold 7.746 futures — band breach, Δp 9.05 → 1.30
--
-- Every one of those rows reports `spot $4423.29`. XAUTUSD's own row in the
-- chain said **4295.55**. A 4320 call cannot be quoted at 8.00 with spot at
-- 4423 — that is 103 of intrinsic value alone. The premiums were real and the
-- spot was not: they came from different snapshots.
--
--     v_spot := max(spot_price) from delta_chain where <XAUT symbols>
--
-- max() takes the highest value any row holds. The chain has not been pruned
-- since 0050 swapped `delete + insert` for an upsert, so a strike the venue
-- stops quoting keeps its last row for ever — bid, delta and spot_price frozen
-- at that moment. Once any row had seen 4423, max() returned 4423 for ever,
-- however current the rest of the table was.
--
-- Then everything downstream did its job on a wrong number:
--
--   * the entry priced strikes off live bids but judged nothing against spot,
--     so it sold calls at 4320/4330/4340
--   * the ATM rule measured those strikes against 4423 and found all three
--     "at or through the money", so it closed the lot
--   * closing three short calls removed their negative delta, Δp jumped to 9.05
--   * the hedge sold 8.2 XAUT of futures to answer a breach that never happened
--
-- This is the Bitcoin incident again with the foreign symbol removed. 0057
-- scoped spot to XAUT and cross-checked it against the XAUTUSD mark, and neither
-- helps here: the bad row *is* XAUT, and 4423 against 4295 is 3% — well inside
-- the 20% guard. Scoping the aggregate was treating the symptom. The aggregate
-- was the problem.
--
-- Two changes:
--
--   1. Prune. Anything not refreshed within two minutes is dropped. The poller
--      runs every five seconds and the reply carries the whole live XAUT set, so
--      a row that goes two minutes without an update is not being quoted any
--      more. This restores the property `delete + insert` gave for free before
--      0050 — a stale row cannot outlive the cycle that stopped seeing it.
--
--   2. Stop aggregating. Spot is read from the XAUTUSD row, which is upserted
--      from every reply and is therefore current by construction. If the reply
--      carries no perpetual, the fallback is the single most recently refreshed
--      option row — still one row's own reading, never a max across rows.
--
-- A held leg whose strike gets pruned now shows up at the missing-delta gate,
-- by name (0056), instead of being priced off a frozen quote. That is the right
-- trade: standing down beats trading on a number nobody is quoting.
--
-- Nothing else in the engine changes.
