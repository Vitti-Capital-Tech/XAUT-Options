-- Two faults that only bite together, and did: the cut and the band correction
-- were trading against each other every cycle, each lap paying the bid-ask
-- spread. Observed on a live account at roughly one round trip every six seconds
-- -- 137 fills and -$2,724 in a morning, with no market move involved at all.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The loop, as it ran
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--     Dp -2.28, INSIDE the band          margin over the cap
--       -> cut fires. Dp is inside, so the old side test returned null and the
--          cut had no preference; it took the deepest-in-the-money short, which
--          was a put
--       -> closing short puts removes positive delta: Dp falls to -13.41, far
--          outside the band                margin now at the target
--       -> next cycle: breach low -> the correction sells puts
--       -> it re-sells the very strike the cut just bought back. Dp returns to
--          -2.28, margin returns over the cap
--       -> repeat
--
-- Sold on the bid at 2.80, bought back on the ask at 3.60. The entire loss was
-- the spread, ten times a minute.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Fault 1 -- the cut manufactured the breach it was then answering
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- `v_cutside` was derived from whether Dp had breached, so it was null for every
-- Dp inside the band, and the ordering fell through to ITM distance alone. On a
-- short strangle that is whichever leg spot has drifted nearest -- chosen with no
-- regard for what closing it does to Dp.
--
-- It now reads against the band's midpoint, which is defined at every Dp. Below
-- the mid, closing a call raises Dp; above it, closing a put lowers it. The cut
-- moves Dp toward the middle while it frees the margin, instead of having to
-- choose between the two. On a genuine breach it gives the same answer as before,
-- so nothing changes on the path that already worked.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Fault 2 -- the correction manufactured the cut
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- It sized purely off Dp, so it would re-block the exact margin the cut had just
-- freed and put the book straight back over the cap. It is now trimmed to what
-- the cap has left, priced per lot the same way the cut prices its own.
--
-- This is what makes the intent of 0041 actually hold: sell freely up to the cap,
-- never through it, and let the cut answer only the breaches that a *price move*
-- causes rather than the ones the book caused itself.
--
-- A consequence worth stating: with margin sitting at the cap and Dp outside the
-- band, the correction now sells nothing and logs that it cannot. Dp stays out
-- until either the market or a take-profit gives the margin back. That is not the
-- hold zone returning -- there is no no-trade band, and every dollar up to the cap
-- is still used -- it is the book having genuinely run out of room to sell, which
-- no amount of trading can fix.
