-- 0068_the_expiry_day_is_the_session_day.sql
--
-- Run this whole file in the Supabase SQL Editor after 0067.
--
-- 0067 moved `today` / `tomorrow` / `friday` off the UTC clock and onto IST,
-- which was the right clock. This moves them onto the right *day*.
--
-- A schedule window may wrap midnight -- 19:01 to 16:30 is a real one on this
-- book -- and for a wrapping window the session day deliberately stays the day
-- the window opened. That is what makes 19:01 Monday through 16:30 Tuesday one
-- session instead of two half ones: `delta_session_window` returns
-- `sday = Monday` for the whole of it, and `session_day`, `entered_day`,
-- `flattened_day`, the roll budget and the shift budget all key off that.
--
-- The expiry rules did not. They counted from the calendar date:
--
--     and to_date(expiry_label, 'DDMMYY') >= (now() at time zone 'Asia/Kolkata')::date + 1
--
-- So at IST midnight the rule moved under the session it belongs to. A window
-- opened Monday 19:01 asking for `tomorrow` sold Tuesday's expiry at the open
-- and then, from 00:00 Tuesday, called *Wednesday's* "tomorrow" -- while the
-- book it was managing held Tuesday's. Everything the engine sold after midnight
-- went onto a different contract from the book it was correcting:
--
--   * a band correction's fresh OTM short (delta books),
--   * an ATM shift's replacement leg,
--   * a re-entry after the session day rolls.
--
-- Two expiries in one book, from one window, with one rule. And Delta prices
-- them differently enough that the band maths reads a strike that is not there:
-- 30 points from spot buys $5 of premium at eight hours to settlement and 80
-- points buys it at thirty-two. A "roll further out" computed against one and
-- filled on the other is not the trade the rules document describes.
--
-- The fix is to count from `v_day` -- the session day the rest of the cycle
-- already keys off -- so a window trades one expiry from open to close.
--
-- What this does not change:
--
--   * A book with no schedule windows, and a session that does not wrap. There
--     `sday` *is* the calendar day, so all three rules resolve exactly as they
--     did under 0067.
--   * `today` on a window that outlives its own contract. A 0-DTE expiry settles
--     at 16:00 UTC -- 21:30 IST -- and a window still open at 21:31 has no
--     today's-expiry left to name whatever day it counts from. The liveness
--     filter drops it and the rule falls through to the nearest live contract,
--     which is the honest answer: the contract is gone. A window meant to hold a
--     position overnight wants `tomorrow`, not `today`.
--   * The `+ interval '16 hours'` liveness filters, untouched again. When a
--     contract dies is an instant, not a day.
--
-- 0067's engine verbatim with those three dates changed. The browser is changed
-- in step: `resolveTargetExpiry` takes the session day as an anchor, and
-- `pickSessionExpiry` is now the one place that answers "which expiry is this
-- book trading" -- `CycleInput` no longer accepts a pre-resolved one, because
-- both callers were resolving it from the raw account config and the calendar
-- day.
